# Turtle-Run-Away
This is an weekly assignment of Opensource Software Course

*Plot:
The main character is an agressive red turtle. Like many of us's mom, his mom compares him to a very briliant blue turtle all the time. Very upset, he decided to 
chase and bully the poor blue turtle after school. The thing is... the blue turtle is always side by side with his mom so our main character must find a way to 
get closer to the blue turtle but also not get caught by the blue turtle's mom.
